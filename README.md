# Spring Boot 3 - Spring Security

- Implementation for DAO Auth Provider
- If u see, This time i haven't provide custom authentication
cuz we have this ready made auth.
- And it's optional to set the password encoder for DAO auth
cuz it by default sets _**DelegationPasswordEncoder**_

  <code>Username: admin</code>
  <code>Password: 12345</code>
